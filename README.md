â€¢	Developed a deep learning model to predict facial attributes (gender, age, hair color, expressions, and accessories) using the CelebA dataset. Implemented a CNN for feature extraction and classification, optimizing the model with Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Improved model performance through hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and batch size adjustments.
